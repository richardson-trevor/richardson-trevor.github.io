Today I learned it's possible to center code in JetBrains products. This is apparently part of what they use to support the distraction-free mode. If you don't want to completely get rid of tool Windows, etc. but still want to center the code, you can use [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44796433/centre-code-in-android-studio-intellij-idea-editor/44802228#answer-44802228).

Essentially, it comes down to going to `Help -> Edit Custom VM Options` then enter `-Deditor.distraction.free.mode=true`.

Craft on.
